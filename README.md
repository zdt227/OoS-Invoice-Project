# OoS-Invoice-Project

This is mostly spaghetti code at this point, with bits and pieces of stuff I've been working on.

1) Main.py contains some testing I did with adding invoice objects to an excel spreadsheet.

2) Invoice.py contains the invoice object which will be used to store parameters.

3) test.py is me fiddling around with pytesseract, trying to figure out how to get it to fully extract the image file's text.

4) SampleInvoice.png is a sample of what the invoices look like. When this project is fully implemented, there will be multiple kinds of invoices we will need to sucessfully interpret.

5) Invoice_data.xls is the spreadsheet which data is currently being written to.
